# Functional Components Learning Session

*A very not-comprehensive introduction to the benefits of functional components.*

I think the best way to learn about the benefits of functional components (especially, in this case, the `useEffect` hook), is to implement a class component which eventually runs into a common issue faced by complex components. The world of functional components is huge, too huge for a single learning session, so I think a focused and specific practical example is the best approach to getting started with seeing the benefits of functional components.

As an aside, I recommend reading these articles:

- [How Are Function Components Different from Classes?](https://overreacted.io/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/)
- [Writing Resilient Components](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/)
