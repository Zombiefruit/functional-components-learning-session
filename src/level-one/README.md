# Level One

Welcome to level one.

Let's create an app. Something incredible. Something exciting. Something cutting-edge.

What's that you say? A weather app? Wow, great idea!

Let's build a simple weather app. To begin, let's just list a couple of cities in a dropdown that a user can select from, and then we'll display the temperature for each.

To start, let's add `<select>` component with three cities to choose from: Toronto, Bangladesh, and Haifa.

- Once finished, let's make it controlled.
- Then create a field that shows the current city name and shows a blank weather (create state field for temperature).
- Next, sign up at openweather for an API key (worst case we'll use mine if it doesn't work immediately)
- Then create the fetchWeather method and call it in componentDidMount. What goes wrong when you try to change the city?

Okay, good job. Let's go to level two.
